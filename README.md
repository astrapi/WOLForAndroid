WOLForAndroid
=============

Wake On Lan for Android
This application is mainly two things:
1. an app that can, on button push wake your pc of choise (based on mac and network address of your LAN)<br /> 
2. an optional library for others to use WOL, natrually it requires changes and removing Application etc.. but it's possible.<br /> 

ToDos:
1. add either broadcast or a static class that takes listeners and emmits a response for each WOL request with the result.
2. add push notification
3. add a library that can scan the local net and give you suggestions regarding the pc's you can wake up.
